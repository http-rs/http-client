//! Types and traits for http clients.
//!
//! This crate has been extracted from `surf`'s internals, but can be used by any http client impl.
//! The purpose of this crate is to provide a unified interface for multiple HTTP client backends,
//! so that they can be abstracted over without doing extra work.

/// ## Spawning new request from middleware
/// When threading the trait through a layer of middleware, the middleware must be able to perform
/// new requests. In order to enable this we pass an `HttpClient` instance through the middleware,
/// with a `Clone` implementation. In order to spawn a new request, `clone` is called, and a new
/// request is enabled.
///
/// How `Clone` is implemented is up to the implementors, but in an ideal scenario combining this
/// with the `Client` builder will allow for high connection reuse, improving latency.
