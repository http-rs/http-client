//! Types and traits for http clients.
//!
//! This crate has been extracted from `surf`'s internals, but can be used by any http client impl.
//! The purpose of this crate is to provide a unified interface for multiple HTTP client backends,
//! so that they can be abstracted over without doing extra work.

/// When threading the trait through a layer of middleware, the middleware must be able to perform
/// new requests. In order to enable this efficiently an `HttpClient` instance may want to be passed
/// though middleware for one of its own requests, and in order to do so should be wrapped in an
/// `Rc`/`Arc` to enable reference cloning.
